> [!WARNING]
> **hardtime.nvim is configured with maximum strictness!**
>
> **Since I want to learn VIM Motions I have enabled hardtime-nvim with
> precognition!**
>
> - Holding or repeating `h/j/k/l` and other basic motions is discouraged.
> - You may see popups or be blocked for inefficient navigation.
> - This is intentional — to help you master efficient Vim motions.
>
> **Toggle it:** Press `<leader>ht` to turn Hardtime ON or OFF at any time.
>
> **Tip:** Don’t be afraid to disable it when you want a break!
>
> **Turn OFF:** You can turn the plugin off in `config/plugins/hardtime.nix`

## Features

- **Text-Editor/IDE**: Schrovimger aims to provide a non-bloated, minimal and
  distraction-free code writing experience.

- **NVF Integration:** Build upon the
  [NVF](https://github.com/NotAShelf/nvf.git) Framework which gives it a solid
  base for your personal configuration.

- **Customization:** The [NVF](https://github.com/NotAShelf/nvf.git) Framework
  provides customization options that are unrestricted, allowing it to be
  tailored according to your preferences.

- **Plugin Supports:** [NVF](https://github.com/NotAShelf/nvf.git) has various
  plugins also allowing to add your custom plugins.

## Installation

Getting Schrovimger installed and running on your system is a **easy AF**.
Simply follow the installation guide below and Schrovimger will get running in
no time.

### InCase you'd like to test run:

```shell
nix run github:jack-thesparrow/schrovimger
```

Or if your have `cachix` installed and configured properly, you can skip the
compilation time by using the cachix binary cache, that way you will only have
to download the binaries.

```shell
nix run github:jack-thesparrow/schrovimger \
--option extra-substituters https://schrovimger.cachix.org \
--option extra-trusted-public-keys "schrovimger.cachix.org-1:wUDg44FWjTBa3CutgbINFRAEb8N5P2yTWze45jcGvMY="
```

### How to install Schrovimger in your system

To include the configuration as a replacement of Vanilla Neovim, you must first
add it as input in your main `flake.nix` of your NixOS system:

```nix
inputs.nvf = {
    url = "github:jack-thesparrow/schrovimger";
    inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
}
```

Then expose the input into your outputs as:

```nix
outputs = {
    ...
    nvf,
    ...
}@inputs:
```

This allows you to install Schrovimger as both: NixOS package and as a
Home-Manager Module. I recommend you to install this configuration as a
Home-Manager module.

Now add `inputs` into your `extraSpecialArgs` of your Home-Manager
Configuration:

```nix
  homeConfigurations = {
    rahul = home-manager.lib.homeManagerConfiguration {
      inherit pkgs;
      modules = [
        ./home/home.nix
      ];
      extraSpecialArgs = {
        inherit inputs;
      };
    };
  };
};
```

Here is a sample `neovim.nix` module which you can import into your Home-Manager
Configuration and then rebuild your system.

```nix
{
  pkgs,
  inputs,
  ...
}@args:
{
  home.packages = [
    inputs.nvf.packages.${pkgs."x86_64-linux"}.default
  ];
}
```

<I>And now you have successfully installed Schrovimger NVF NeoVim
Configuration!</I>
